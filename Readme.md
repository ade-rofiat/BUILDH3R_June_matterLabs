# Build smart contract

This learning process provided a robust foundation in Ethereum smart contract development, deployment, and interaction. Practical exercises and progress documentation on GitHub allowed me to gain practical experience and develop a relevant portfolio. I learned to create ERC20 tokens, handle hashed messages on the blockchain, and automate contract interactions using ethers.js. Furthermore, I examined zkSync and paymasters for transaction fee handling and token balance management.
